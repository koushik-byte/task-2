**Nunjucks** - A powerful templating language for JavaScript with inheritance, asynchronous control, and more.

**Vite** - A modern, fast build tool that provides instant server start and lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement).


1. **Install dependencies:**
   npm install

2. **Run development server:**
   npm run dev
   The development server will start at `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Build for production:**
   npm run build
   The compiled output will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

4. **Preview production build:**
   npm run preview


This project helped me understand how to use Nunjucks for modular template design and Vite for efficient bundling and build automation. It strengthened my knowledge of modern frontend workflows, project structure organization, and deployment-ready build processes
